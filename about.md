[jEdit][jedit] is a highly configurable crossplatform editor. With the console plugin and the right configuration it can behave as though it were an ide, but it is much lighter on resources than say [netbeans][nb] (which would be ideal except that it is bit slow with ruby). Of course if you are already have a favourite editor say [vim][vim] you will likely stick with that.

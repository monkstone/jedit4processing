#jedit4processing#
Since processing version 2.0b6, there is the possiblity of running processing scripts from the command line. That is not super convenient in itself, but coupled with a decent programmers editor such as vim (that I'm using here), emacs, textmate or jEdit you can run scripts without the need to move away from the editor.
##jedit##
Get jEdit [here]("http://www.jedit.org"), you can download some of jEdit tools at the jEdit community website, but it is  bit unreliable so I'm including the scripts in a download here.

##alternative language support##
I've also produced tools for working with [processing.py](https://github.com/monkstone/processing.py-examples) and [ruby-processing](https://github.com/jashkenas/ruby-processing/wiki/Other-Resources)

### Exploring JRubyArt examples

Use the powerful search tool built into jEdit to explore code usage in the JRubyArt examples.

First highlight the code you want search for, in the example below we highlight `map1d` (Alt 's', return) brings up the `Search And Replace` pop up, which we can just use to explore (just don't click replace). We can seach a particular directory and choose a particular filetype in the filter (as a bonus this directory gets remembered so once set you won't need to enter it again). In the example below, it looks as though you have github cloned the examples repository. If instead you downloaded them using `k9 setup unpack_samples` they would be in the `k9_samples` folder in your `home` directory.

### The search pop-up

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/highlight.png" />

Click on find

### The results

See the results with `map1d` highlighted, and highlighted file that has been selected (by clicking on it).

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/search-result.png" />

The selected file (`surface.rb` above), gets opened for viewing in the edit buffer.
